                <h2>PART ONE &ndash; OVERVIEW</h2>

                <p class="long-copy">
    &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; Entering the job market is intimidating to many job seekers and newly graduated college students. It does not have to be this way. Our goal is to provide job seekers knowledge they can use to make job seekers more competitive. When someone is searching for an employment opportunity, they take into account the industry, company, duties, salary, location, and many other features. The purpose of this project is to gather, explore, and analyze job listing data to provide job seekers with insight on the skills required for a full-time data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, and business intelligence positions across the United States. 


                </p>
                <p class="long-copy">
&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; Our team decided to collect data by scraping job postings from the Cybercoder and the Simplyhired. Through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining (TM) methods, we obtained insights and recognized patterns that are unknown to the typical job seeker. We took a particular interest in the skill-set information as well as salary estimates provided by the job websites and then related our findings to geographic regions by comparing and contrasting skill requirements in different states, cities, and broader areas such as the east and west coast.

                <h3>Data Collection</h3> </div>
                <p class="long-copy">
                    Our initial goal for collecting job data was to scrape the Indeed website (https://www.indeed.com) since it is the most popular job website and has the largest population of listings. However, after our team scraped approximately 500 listings and attempted to clean the data, we encountered a large number of issues that would be too difficult to tackle in our 10-week timeline.
                </p>
                
                <p class="long-copy">
                    After exploring Indeed (https://www.indeed.com) and other job sites we discovered two that our team felt aligned with the scope of our project, held a clean structure for scraping, and contained the information that allowed us to perform our analysis.  Therefore, we landed on Cybercoder (https://www.cybercoders.com), and Simplyhired (https://www.simplyhired.com). These are suitable for our project because they contained the following data, which met our criteria: Titles, Job Descriptions, Preferred Skills, Locations, Salaries.
                </p>
               
                
                <div class="center">
                <i class="icon ion-md-options icon-big"></i>

                    <h3>Data Overview</h3></div>
                <p class="long-copy">
                    The two charts below show a brief overview of the two datasets that we have scraped. As we can see here, we have collected mostly complete information for each of the jobs types. With a complete dataset (lacking null values) we can conduct a more in-depth exploration of the relationships and lack thereof these job types have with each other. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="long-copy">
                    Also, it is worth noting that the Cybercoder dataset after cleaning contains descriptions, skills, location, and salary estimates but lacks companies and industry data. The lack of company information is most likely because staffing agencies use Cybercoder and their client's information is kept confidential to job seekers unless contacted by the recruiter. The lack of this company information is a downfall of this dataset; however, for our purposes, the data is still suitable. Missing company information is not the only drawback of the Cybercoder data; it is not big enough as it only has 519 postings making it relatively smaller compared to the Simplyhired data. Also, the proportions of job types within the population skew in one direction due to 67.2% of the listing data distributed to the Data Engineer position. Unfortunately, we do not know if this is true to the real world. Meaning we do not know if the demand for Data Engineer positions is several times higher than other data related positions.
                </p>
                
                <p class="long-copy">
                    However, when we turned to the Simplyhired dataset, we can see that it is enormous. With a massive number of job postings, we can gain greater insight into the relationship the preferred skills have with other fields and be able to more precisely analyze how job types are stratified geographically, thus making it a more robust analysis. However, unlike the Cybercoder website where salary information is known to the recruiter, we later discovered that the salary data are estimates calculated by the Simplyhired website and are therefore not going to be representative of the actual values.

                    <constraint> <p><br><br>California, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, Virginia, and Washington stand out in that they represent each of the four job types. This finding makes sense because these states have a significant number of technology companies and therefore data related jobs. For example, unrelated to our data, CA with the Bay Area is the hub for everything data with companies like Facebook and Google that have warehouses holding and processing roughly 300 Petabytes of data each ( 322,122,547,200 megabytes). That is almost a comprehensible amount of data, and with that in mind, it makes sense that companies in California are in need of filling Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Business Intelligence positions. It is worth noting, some states are very particular in the jobs posted in their state and this can be related to the industry type representing these listings in that state. </p></constraint>

<br><br>We can see that 9 out of the top 15 represented cities are located in the Bay Area, making it a great place to look for a data science related position. It also reveals an exciting part of our job listing population that aligns with our previous findings. We can see that California has a diverse option for the cities where one can search for listings. Once again, this is related to the vast number of companies seeking those that have the skills necessary to understand the immense amount of data they are collecting. The other states do not have these diverse set of city options, indicating that majority of technology firms in these states are only in specific cities.

                        <p>Top Skills -  Overall and for Each Job Type
<br><br>The requirements for each job type (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Business Intelligence) differ across the population. As expected, due to the technicality required in these roles, we found that programming languages and business applications are pivotal in being able to qualify for these job types. In particular, the most surprising being Python, which has gained some traction in the data science world and is the most demanded skill for Data Scientists and the second to Java for Data Engineers. This finding can add some evidence to the Python versus R debate, and which one is the most commonly used by businesses.<br><br>

Another skill that is worth noting is the need for candidates with SQL skills. SQL is demanded across all job types and learning this is necessary for making yourself the most competitive candidate. Knowing SQL should be expected though because each of these job types requires the collection, cleaning, and use of data which almost always requires the use of databases. Thus, knowledge of SQL is a must to be a self-reliant member of your team.

<br><br>Analyzing the expected earnings from two different perspectives returns two vastly different results.  We found that Washington DC and Illinois have the highest expected minimum and maximum earnings. However, when we change perspectives and look at the highest expected minimum and maximum earnings by location only, we find that California is highest earning based on city locations with 8 out of 10 in the minimum perspective and 5 out of 10 in the maximum perspective. A difference between these two subsets is likely due to some outliers with very high earnings in the state's perspective skewing the earnings in one direction. Once again, the Bay Area is the best place to look for a high salary.

<br><br>The Data Engineer job type has the highest earnings variance and therefore the most fluctuation out of the group. In contrast, the Data Analyst position has the lowest earnings variance and therefore the least fluctuation out of the four positions. The Data Analyst position having the lowest variance in earnings is likely due to it being an entry-mid career position. Moreover, the Data Engineer position can vary from entry-end career resulting in broader low and high salary range. We found it surprising that the mean salary distributions for the Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Business Intelligence are very close, but the minimum and maximum ranges are different which may support the experience level hypothesis.

                        We found that information about location exists in every posting and is a reliable source of information, so we decided to focus on the relationship between geographic features and job skills. We choose to use Simplyhired dataset because it has enormous numbers of postings, complete attributes and seldom missing value.
 
                        We can see that jobs cluster within the west coast and east area of USA compared to relatively scarce points scatter in the central part of the State. The result matches our expectation since the population in USA is distributed roughly in this way. And also because data-related job is a relatively new job type and relates to key words like high-tech, massive data, fast developing speed and so on. It is not hard to see the correlation between  job distribution and economic and technology development level of that place. Due to gathering effect, newly emerged enterprises like to set their locations in places having mature infrastructure, developed economy and abundant talents.

                    Since the last map is not intuitive in showing the extent of the distribution of job postings (because it is grouped by location and no matter how many jobs there are, each location is represented by a single point). So we also made a choropleth map of the job postings. <br><br>
                The darker color indicates areas with a higher number of job postings and therefore high demand for data science related talent. California, Washington, Nevada, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all have an ample supply of businesses hiring for these types of jobs (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst).

For any prospective worker, location is one of the most critical factors in deciding whether or not one might take a job offer. With a more local perspective, an in-state job seeker (i.e., someone living in Los Angeles, CA) may know that they need to relocate in advance due to many technology jobs located in the Bay Area. Location is essential in the job search, that is why conducting a detailed analysis of the geographic distribution of our population necessary.

                                Both the east and west coast expect candidates to have experience and an aptitude for teamwork and collaboration. The ability to finish projects or experience doing projects increases the competitiveness of the candidate. Both SQL and database appeared in east and west and are ranked very high. So it is not hard to tell its importance. Both sides think candidates should know HA (High Availability), ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), pipeline, mapping, amp. Other skills include modeling, data mining, machine learning, data cleaning, and visualization.

                                What appeared most on the east coast is python, it seems that this region prefers candidates to have programming skills. Other skills that only appears on the east coast is Hadoop and Microsoft Excel. Skills that appear only in the west is Microsoft, but we can not tell it is a skill or the company (since its headquarters are on the west coast). The Bioinformatician only appears on the west coast. Having a high level of "responsibility" is the most emphasized personality of candidates from both east and west. Communication skills and leadership is also a plus for candidates.

                                However, overall, the difference between east and west coast is not apparent, they differ slightly in some specific job skills, but more often they share the same job skill requirements. It actually can be justified since globalization has led to convergence, technology shortened distances. Differences caused by geographic factor alone is not that obvious anymore. So it is normal to have same expectation for a job position. And another reason we can think of is that requirements listed in job postings are broad in themselves. For example, almost every company wants SQL talents but surely they will emphasize on different application on SQL, but they will not post in such a specific way, and we can not capture information like that, making our result of the difference between east and west coast seems similar.

                After the first step of writing our project proposal, we set out to do data collection and data cleaning. We spent much time finding suitable websites. Later we discovered that it is difficult to do our initial goal, which is salary predictions since the information about it is hard to collect and its source is not reliable. At last, we found two websites provide data that meet our expectations.
            </p>
            
            <p class="long-copy">
                Although every dataset is not perfect, we take advantage of each data source and compliment the drawbacks of one with the advantage of the other one. We used Cybercoder dataset to conduct an overall analysis. First, we looked at the composition of the four types of job postings. Then we looked at job distribution and job proportion of each state, and then we found states and cities that are popular for data-related jobs. Next, we turned to skill analysis where we wanted to know what is the most in-demand skills in each job title and the overall data jobs. In the salary section, we analyzed it in two parts, first is to compare the earnings in different states and cities, second is to compare salary between different job types. For the Simplyhired dataset, we took full advantage of its enormous quantity to do geo analysis. After discovering the distribution of job postings, we grouped job locations into two groups then compared skills between the two coast.

            <p class="long-copy">
                Overall, we found our analysis to be challenging but also rewarding. As college students, we are entering the job market soon, and after doing our analysis, we hope that our readers find our work informative. Each job type in this field is similar, but they each hold their responsibilities, skills demanded, and salary expectations for a particular geographic location. As a result of our findings relating to the preferred skills section of our report, a job seeker can learn these skills to better prepare as a  competitive candidate. Learning the top skills demanded by these positions is only one example of how our results are useful to any reader that is seeking a job.

            <p class="long-copy">
                Unfortunately, there are no easy answers to many of our questions, and we wish that we had more time because we would have done a more detailed analysis of the descriptions and salary information. All in all, our team had much fun working on this project together, and we hope that you enjoy reading and learning more about the job market for data science positions!
