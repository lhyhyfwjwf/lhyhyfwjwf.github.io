                <h2>PART ONE &ndash; OVERVIEW</h2>

                <p class="long-copy">
    &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; Entering the job market is intimidating to many job seekers and newly graduated college students. It does not have to be this way. Our goal is to provide job seekers knowledge they can use to make job seekers more competitive. When someone is searching for an employment opportunity, they take into account the industry, company, duties, salary, location, and many other features. The purpose of this project is to gather, explore, and analyze job listing data to provide job seekers with insight on the skills required for full-time data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, and business intelligence positions across the United States. 


                </p>
                <p class="long-copy">
&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; Our team decided to collect data by scraping job postings from the Cybercoder  and the Simplyhired. Through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining (TM) methods, we obtained insights and recognized patterns that are unknown to the typical job seeker. We took a particular interest in the skill-set information as well as salary estimates provided by the job websites and then related our findings to geographic regions by comparing and contrasting skill requirements in different states, cities, and broader areas such as the east and west coast.

                    <h3>Approach to the data</h3> <p>we decided to find website that has regular patterns thus making it easy to scrap and extract skill set information. And we also want each posting has complete information, including salary information. After exploring, we think Cybercoder (http://www.cybercoders.com) and Simplyhired (https://www.simplyhired.com/) are suitable for our purposes</p>

                    <h3>Dataset description</h3>
                    <p>
                        From charts below we can see that this two datasets have attributes have included all we want to explore. But both have potential drawbacks. For cybercoder dataset, it is not big enough and its composition is potentially skewed to data engineer title. When we turned to simplyhired dataset we can see that it has huge number of job postings, but we later discovered that the salary information is doubtable since it is estimated by website.

                    <h3>Techniques</h3>
                    <p>For web scraping part, we first tried API, but failed to find any resources, then we built crawlers for Simplyhired and Cybercoder and used Xpath and beautifulsoup to do webscraping. We also spent a lot of time preprocessing text data. We want to get job-skill words out of long, distracting job descriptions, and also extract salary data, location data and so on. For NLP part, we used Regex, Stopwords, Wordnet Lemmatizer.

This finding makes sense because these states have a significant number of technology companies and therefore data related jobs. For example, unrelated to our data, CA with the Bay Area is the hub for everything data with companies like Facebook and Google that have warehouses holding and processing roughly 300 Petabytes of data each ( 322,122,547,200 megabytes). That is almost a comprehensible amount of data, and with that in mind, it makes sense that companies in California are in need of filling Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Business Intelligence positions. It is worth noting, some states are very particular in the jobs posted in their state and this can be related to the industry type representing these listings in that state. </p></constraint>

<br><br>We can see that 9 out of the top 15 represented cities are located in the Bay Area, making it a great place to look for a data science related position. Figure 1.5 also reveals an exciting part of our job listing population that aligns with our previous findings. We can see that California has a diverse option for the cities where one can search for listings. Once again, this is related to the vast number of companies seeking those that have the skills necessary to understand the immense amount of data they are collecting. The other states do not have these diverse set of city options, indicating that majority of technology firms in these states are only in specific cities.

                        <p>Top Skills -  Overall and for Each Job Type
<br><br>The requirements for each job type (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Business Intelligence) differ across the population. As expected, due to the technicality required in these roles, we found that programming languages and business applications are pivotal in being able to qualify for these job types. In particular, the most surprising being Python, which has gained some traction in the data science world and is the most demanded skill for Data Scientists and the second to Java for Data Engineers. This finding can add some evidence to the Python versus R debate, and which one is the most commonly used by businesses.<br><br>

Another skill that is worth noting is the need for candidates with SQL skills. As seen in Figure 1.7, SQL is demanded across all job types and learning this is necessary for making yourself the most competitive candidate. Knowing SQL should be expected though because each of these job types requires the collection, cleaning, and use of data which almost always requires the use of databases. Thus, knowledge of SQL is a must to be a self-reliant member of your team.

<br><br>Analyzing the expected earnings from two different perspectives returns two vastly different results.  We found that Washington DC and Illinois have the highest expected minimum and maximum earnings. However, when we change perspectives and look at the highest expected minimum and maximum earnings by location only, we find that California is highest earning based on city locations with 8 out of 10 in the minimum perspective and 5 out of 10 in the maximum perspective. A difference between these two subsets is likely due to some outliers with very high earnings in the state's perspective skewing the earnings in one direction. Once again, the Bay Area is the best place to look for a high salary.

<br><br>The Data Scientist position is highest paid job type out of the group. This is not very surprising Data Scientists have the most experience and in most cases is not a entry level position. Whereas Data Analyst is the lowest earning, likely due to the least amount of experience required to obtain this position. An interesting findings is that the Business Intelligence and Data Engineer position switch places when going from minimum to maximum earnings. This may indicate that Data Engineers have a higher earning potential mid-end career.

                        We used Simplyhired dataset, and we group the jobpostings by location and plot out on the google map. Blue points are for data scientist job postings, yellow points are for data analyst job postings and red points are for data engineering job postings. If you click on each point, you can see the job salary for each posting grouped by the same location, skills of those postings, counting number of each skill and the number of postings of this location. <br>
From this graph we can see that data related jobs are gathered in west coast and east of US compared to relatively scarce points scattered in central part of the State. But we find it hard to explore skill information. So next we will further group the job postings on coast level and state level to compare the skill sets.

                Darker color means higher number of job postings, and we will assume this place needs data related talents and has more job opportunities. So we can see that California, Washington, Nevada, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut are all popular places for finding data related jobs.

For any prospective worker, location is one of the most important factors in deciding whether or not one might take a job offer or not. On a small scale, an in state prospect from San Jose, CA may want to relocate in advance knowing that most jobs are in Southern California. Knowing here high density locations for jobs give people an idea of where they will work before they actually do. On a larger scale, a person out of state may want to reconsider job searches if a position is located too far from where they currently are.

                            <p>We can see that the requirements overall are very similar. Both east coast and west coast expect candidates to have experience, and be good at team working and collaboration. The ability of finishing projects or experience doing projects will increase competence of candidate. Both SQL and database appeared in east and west and are ranked very high. So it is not hard to tell its importance. Both sides think candidates should know ha(High Availability), etl (Extract, transform, load)
, pipeline, mapping, amp. Not to mention modeling, data mining, machine learning, data cleaning and visualization.

                            <p>What appeared in east coast is python, it seems that east prefers candidates to have programming skills. Other skills that only appears in east coast is Hadoop, Excel. Skills that appear only in west is Microsoft, but we can’t tell it is a skill or Microsoft company (since its headquarters are on west coast). And bioinformatician only appears in west coast. Responsibility is the most emphasized personality of candidates by both east and west. Communication skills and leadership is also a plus for candidates.

                            <p>But overall, the difference between east and west coast is not obvious, they differ slightly in some certain job skills, but more often they share the same job skill requirements. It actually can be justified since globalization has led to convergence, and since requirements listed in job postings are basic, it is normal that they need to be met by candidates no matter where they will be working. </p>
